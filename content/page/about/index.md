Hey!  
I'm Hari Chalise, a Linux enthusiast specializing in Bash scripting and passionate about open source. I've been actively contributing to the Linux community for over a year, particularly within the Arch Linux ecosystem, where I focus on creating efficient and customized solutions.

My tech journey began with a fascination for Linux, leading me to explore system management and kernel customization. I'm proficient in Bash scripting and am currently learning Rust. I'm excited by its potential for building secure and efficient systems.
